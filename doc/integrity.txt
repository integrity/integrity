Integrity
=========

As soon as you push your commits, Integrity builds your code, run your tests
and makes sure everything works fine. It then reports the build status using
various notifiers back to you and your team so everyone is on the same page
and problems can be fixed right away.

Checkout Integrity watching itself:

Read more about about Continuous Integration on
http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html[Martin Fowler's
website] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration[Wikipedia].

== Installation
Make sure your system meet these prerequisites:

* Ruby >= 1.8.6
* RubyGems >= 1.3.5
* git >= 1.6

Then grab Integrity via git, install its dependencies and create the database:
[source, shell]
$ gem install bundler
$ git clone git://github.com/integrity/integrity
$ cd integrity
$ git checkout -b deploy master
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db

To give it a quick try before going any further, run `bundle exec rackup` and
navigate to http://0.0.0.0:9292.

Upgrade:
[source, shell]
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/master

NOTE: Integrity ships with different Gemfile.lock files for Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.
      If you wish to use a Gemfile.lock file shipped with Integrity,
      copy or rename one of Gemfile.lock.ruby18 or Gemfile.lock.ruby19
      to Gemfile.lock.

== Configuration
Integrity is configured via the `init.rb` file using Ruby.
[source, ruby]
----
Integrity.configure do |c|
  c.database                    = "sqlite3:integrity.db"
  c.directory                   = "builds"
  c.base_url                    = "http://ci.example.org"
  c.log                         = "integrity.log"
  c.builder                     = :threaded, 5
  c.build_all                   = true
  c.project_default_build_count = 10
end
----

=== Basic settings
database:: Any valid database URI supported by
http://datamapper.org/[DataMapper].
* `sqlite3:integrity.db`
* `mysql://user:password@localhost/integrity`
* `postgres://user:password@localhost/integrity`

IMPORTANT: You need to install the appropriate `data_objects` adapter as well.
The SQLite3 adapter (`do_sqlite3`) is installed by default.

directory:: This is where your projects' code will be checked out. Make sure it
is writable by the user who runs Integrity.
base_url:: Absolute URL to your Integrity instance, *without* a trailing slash.
This setting is optional but is required to have proper links in notifications.
log:: Path to the Integrity log file; mostly useful for troubleshooting
build_all!:: Tells Integirty to build every single commit it is notified about.
Only builds the newest otherwise.
auto_branch!:: Say the project _Integrity_ is tracking the master branch, and
I push my _build-duration_ topic branch to GitHub, Integrity will create and
build a new project named _Integrity (build-duration)_ using the same build
command and notifiers.
trim_branches:: When _Integrity_ is set to auto branch, it is possible for a
large number of stale branches to stick around which no longer exist. Turning
this on will automatically detect when a branch is deleted via the GitHub
post-receive hook and delete the build history for the branch.
project_default_build_count:: How many builds to initially show on project
pages. nil, which is the default, means show all builds.
HTTP authentication:: If both the `user` and `pass` settings are set then only
the logged-in users can administer the projects and see the private ones.
[source, ruby]
----
c.username = "admin"
c.password = "password"
----

To protect the whole Integrity instance, set ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD
environment variables before starting Integrity:
[source, bash]
----
export ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret
----

On Heroku:
[source, bash]
----
heroku config:add ADMIN_USERNAME=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret
----

=== Automating the builds
Integrity provides two HTTP endpoints to trigger new builds:

POST /:project/builds:: Causes Integrity to fetch the HEAD of the remote
repository and build it. Note that HTTP authentication applies to it if set.
This endpoint can't be disabled.

POST /github/:token:: Supports GitHub's
https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks[Post-Receive Hook]. Enable it:
[source, ruby]
----
c.github_token = "TOKEN"
----

=== Choosing a builder
Integrity ships with two ways of building your codes in the background.

==== Threaded
The +threaded+ builder pushes the build job to an in-memory queue and processes
them as soon as possible. It relies on Ruby's thread so it doesn't have any
dependency nor requires to run other processes.
[source, ruby]
c.builder = :threaded, 5

The second argument is the size of the thread pool.

==== Delayed::Job
The +dj+ builder queue up the builds into a SQL database using
http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job[Delayed::Job]. To use it, install its
dependencies by uncommenting the relevant lines in the `Gemfile` and run
`bundle lock && bundle install`.

[source, ruby]
c.builder = :dj, { :adapter => "sqlite3", :database => "dj.db" }

The second argument must be a valid
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#method-c-establish_connection[ActiveRecord
connection hash].

Run a worker with `rake jobs:work`. See
http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job#readme[Delayed::Job's documentation]
for more details.

== Notification
After a build status is available, you want to know it **immediately**,
Integrity currently supports three notification mediums: Email, IRC and
http://campfirenow.com[Campfire]. To set it up and use one of these with
your projects:

1. Open the `Gemfile`, uncomment the relevant lines and run
   `bundle lock && bundle install` to install the notifier's dependencies.
2. Edit the `init.rb` file to require it. Example:
+
[source, ruby]
----
require "integrity"
# You need to add this line:
require "integrity/notifier/email"
----
+
3. Restart Integrity and go to the project settings screen where you can
   enable and configure the notifier.

== Deployment
=== http://modrails.com[Phusion Passenger]
Please see Passenger's documentation for
http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html[Apache] and
http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html[Nginx].

NOTE: Currently ThreadedBuilder does not work with Passenger (issue #156).
      Please use DelayedBuilder or ResqueBuilder.

=== http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/[Thin]
1. Uncomment the `thin` line in the Gemfile
2. Run `bundle install` to install Thin

[source, shell]
$ $EDITOR doc/thin.yml
$ thin -C doc/thin.yml start

Then, configure a web proxy. Examples:

.Nginx as a reverse-proxy
----
http {
  upstream builder-integrityapp-com {
  server 127.0.0.1:8910;
  server 127.0.0.1:8911;
}

server {
  server_name builder.integrityapp.com;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://builder-integrityapp-com;
  }
}
----

.Apache acting as reverse proxy to a cluster of thin instances
----
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName integrity.nationalfield.org
        ServerAlias integrity

        ProxyRequests Off
        ProxyPreserveHost On

        <Proxy *>
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
        </Proxy>

        ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8910/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8910/

        ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8911/
</VirtualHost>
----

=== http://unicorn.bogomips.org/[Unicorn]
1. Uncomment the `unicorn` line in the Gemfile
2. Run `bundle install` to install Unicorn

[source, shell]
$ $EDITOR doc/unicorn.rb
$ unicorn -c doc/unicorn.rb -D

Then, configure a web proxy as outlined above for Thin.

== Support / Contributing
You can get in touch via IRC at irc://irc.freenode.net/integrity[#integrity on
freenode]. If no one happens to be around, you can ask our mailing list at
integrity@librelist.com. (http://librelist.com/browser/integrity/[Archives])

If you find a bug, or want to give us a feature request, log it into our
http://github.com/integrity/integrity/issues[bug tracker].

To start hacking, grab the code from our git repository at
`git://github.com/integrity/integrity.git` and setup the dependencies with
`bundle install && bundle lock`. Finally, hack and `bundle exec rake` as
usual ;-)

Once you're done, make sure your changes are rebased on on top of the `master`
branch and open a new ticket in our bug tracker to let us know where we can
pull from.

== FAQ
=== Does it support Subversion or any other SCM?
[[faq-scm]]
Integrity only works with http://git-scm.org[git]. However, git can mirror
other SCMs, for example Subversion via git-svn, and Integrity will work with
such mirrored repositories. It is up to you to keep the mirrored repositories
up to date with your primary repositories.

=== But does it work with <insert tech here>?
[[faq-tech]]
**Absolutely!** As long as your build process can be run from an UNIX-y
environment and that it returns a *zero* status code for success and
*non-zero* for failure, then Integrity works for you.

Integrity
=========

As soon as you push your commits, Integrity builds your code, run your tests
and makes sure everything works fine. It then reports the build status using
various notifiers back to you and your team so everyone is on the same page
and problems can be fixed right away.

Checkout Integrity watching itself at http://builder.integrityapp.com.

Read more about about Continuous Integration on
http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html[Martin Fowler's
website] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration[Wikipedia].

== Installation
Make sure your system meet these prerequisites:

* Ruby >= 1.8.6
* RubyGems >= 1.3.5
* git >= 1.6

Then grab Integrity via git, install its dependencies and create the database:
[source, shell]
$ gem install bundler
$ git clone git://github.com/integrity/integrity
$ cd integrity
$ git checkout -b deploy v0.4.0
$ bundle install
$ bundle lock
$ rake db

If you want give it a quick try before going any further, run
`bundle exec rackup` and navigate to http://0.0.0.0:9292.

Upgrade:
[source, shell]
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/v0.4.0

== Configuration
Integrity is configured via the `init.rb` file using the Ruby syntax. Example:
[source, ruby]
----
Integrity.configure do |c|
  c.database  "sqlite3:integrity.db"
  c.directory "builds"
  c.base_url  "http://ci.example.org"
  c.log       "integrity.log"
  c.builder   :threaded, 5
  c.build_all!
end
----

=== Basic settings
database:: Any valid database URI supported by
http://datamapper.rubyforge.org/dm-core/DataMapper.html[DataMapper]. Examples:
* `sqlite3:integrity.db`
* `mysql://user:password@localhost/integrity`
* `postgres://user:password@localhost/integrity`

IMPORTANT: You need to install the appropriate `data_objects` adapter as well.
The SQLite3 adapter (`do_sqlite3`) is installed by default.

directory:: This is where your projects' code will be checked out. Make sure it
is writable by the user that runs Integrity.
base_url:: Absolute URL to your Integrity instance, *without* a trailing slash.
This setting is optional but is required to have proper links in notifications.
log:: Path to the Integrity log file; mostly useful for troubleshooting
build_all!:: Tells Integirty to build every single commit it is notified about.
Only builds the newest otherwise.
HTTP authentication:: If both the `user` and `pass` settings are set then only
the logged-in users can administer the projects and see the private ones.
Example:
[source, ruby]
----
c.user "admin"
c.pass "password"
----

To protect the whole Integrity instance do this in your `config.ru` file:
[source, ruby]
----
use Rack::Auth::Basic do |user, pass|
  user == "admin" && pass == "secret"
end
run Integrity.app
----

=== Automating the builds
Integrity provides three different HTTP endpoints to trigger new builds:

POST /:project/builds:: Causes Integrity to fetch the HEAD of the remote
repository and build it. Note that HTTP authentication applies to it if set.
This endpoint can't be disabled.

POST /github/:token:: Supports GitHub's
http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks[Post-Receive Hook]. Enable it:
[source, ruby]
----
c.github "TOKEN"
----

POST /push/:token:: Acts the GitHub endpoint but with a simpler payload
format, making it easier to use in custom post-receive hook or cron jobs.
Enable it:
[source, ruby]
----
c.push "TOKEN"
----

Payload example:
----
{
  "uri": "git://example.org/repo.git"
  "branch": "master",
  "commits": [
    {
      "author": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@example.org"
      },
      "timestamp": "2009-12-23 00:01:41 +0100",
      "id": "da90853abfc89b41d40b9f33f240e2e9018fc85f",
      "message": "First commit"
    }
  ]
}
----

=== Choosing a builder
Integrity ships with two ways of building your codes in the background.

==== Threaded
The +threaded+ builder pushes the build job to an in-memory queue and processes
them as soon as possible. It relies on Ruby's thread so it doesn't have any
dependency nor requires to run other processes.
[source, ruby]
c.builder :threaded, 5

The second argument is the size of the thread pool.

==== Delayed::Job
The +dj+ builder queue up the builds into a SQL database using
http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job[Delayed::Job]. To use it, install its
dependencies by uncommenting the relevant lines in the `Gemfile` and running
`bundle lock && bundle install`.

[source, ruby]
c.builder :dj, :adapter => "sqlite3", :database => "dj.db"

The second argument must be a valid
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002364[ActiveRecord
connection hash].

Run a worker with `./bin/rake jobs:work`. Please See
http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job#readme[dj's documentation] for more details.

== Notification
After a build status is available, you want to know it **immediately**,
Integrity currently supports three notification mediums: Email, IRC and
http://campfirenow.com[Campfire]. To set it up and use one of these with
your projects:

1. Open the `Gemfile`, uncomment the relevant lines and run
   `bundle lock && bundle install` to install the notifier's dependencies.
2. Edit the `init.rb` file to require it. Example:
+
[source, ruby]
----
require "integrity"
# You need to add this line:
require "integrity/notifier/email"
----
+
3. Restart Integrity and go to the project settings screen where you can
   enable and configure the notifier.

== Deployment
=== http://heroku.com[Heroku]
Heroku is the easiest and fastest way to deploy Integrity.

[source, shell]
$ cp doc/heroku.rb init.rb
$ git commit -am "Configured for Heroku"
$ gem install heroku
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku rake db
$ heroku open

NOTE: It isn't possible to access repositories over SSH due to Heroku's
      architecture.

=== http://modrails.com[Phusion Passenger]
Please see Passenger's documentation for
http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html[Apache] and
http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html[Nginx].

=== http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/[Thin]
[source, shell]
$ gem install thin
$ $EDITOR doc/thin.yml
$ thin -C doc/thin.yml start

Then, configure a web proxy. Examples:

.Nginx as a reverse-proxy
----
http {
  upstream builder-integrityapp-com {
  server 127.0.0.1:8910;
  server 127.0.0.1:8911;
}

server {
  server_name builder.integrityapp.com;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://builder-integrityapp-com;
  }
}
----

.Apache acting as reverse proxy to a cluster of thin instances
----
<VirtualHost *>
  <Proxy>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
  </Proxy>

  RedirectMatch ^/integrity$ /integrity/
  ProxyRequests Off
  ProxyPass /integrity/ http://localhost:8910/
  ProxyHTMLURLMap http://localhost:8910 /integrity

  <Location /integrity>
    ProxyPassReverse /
    SetOutputFilter proxy-html
    ProxyHTMLURLMap / /integrity/
    ProxyHTMLURLMap /integrity/ /integrity
  </Location>
</VirtualHost>
----

NOTE: If you run Integrity with another deployment strategy please drop us
      us a line at <info@integrityapp.com> and let us know what config
      worked for you so we can include it here.

== Support / Contributing
You can get in touch via IRC at irc://irc.freenode.net/integrity[#integrity on
freenode]. If no one happens to be around, you can ask by emailing our mailing
list at integrity@librelist.com.

If you find a bug, or want to give us a feature request, log it into our
http://github.com/integrity/integrity/issues[bug tracker].

To start hacking, grab the code from our git repository at
`git://github.com/integrity/integrity.git` and setup the dependencies with
`bundle install && bundle lock`. Finally, hack and `bundle exec rake` as
usual ;-)

Once you're done, make sure your changes are rebased on on top of the `master`
branch and open a new ticket in our bug tracker to let us know where we can
pull from.

== FAQ
=== Does it support Subversion or any other SCM?
[[faq-scm]]
No. Integrity only supports http://git-scm.org[git].

=== But does it work with <insert tech here>?
[[faq-tech]]
**Absolutely!** As long as your build process can be run from an UNIX-y
environment and that it returns a *zero* status code for success and
*non-zero* for failure, then Integrity works for you.
